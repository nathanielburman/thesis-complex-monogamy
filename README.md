Complex Binary Chains by Nathaniel M. A. Burman
University of Central Florida School of Business Administration & School of Computer Science & Engineering

A binary chain is formed by contracts between two parties. The chain/contract can last a length of time. Chains can be broken, contracts can be broken.

A Binary Chain is formed by a contract between the two parties.

Binary chains are formed at birth by two parents.

Binary Chains can be different. The baby has parental binary chains with its parents. The parents have a different chain that keeps them together. Parents have binary chains that provide defense against other binary chains and arrangements that they may see in the wild.

A Single Binary Chain is weaker than a double binary chain.
This is a visual tool with which we can visualize human relationships on a graph in time.
Earth itself allows for multiple types of binary arrangements and these illustrations provide insight into how the human relationship really looks and how it could look from above.

ABSTRACT:
This academic paper delves into the intricate nature of human relationships, transcending the simplified portrayals often presented in American school curricula. By introducing the concept of complex binary chains, it explores a powerful tool for visualizing and comprehending the multifaceted dimensions of relationships. These binary structures provide a novel perspective on how parents are intricately connected with their children, offering insights beyond traditional family tree representations. Moreover, the paper elucidates how complex binary chains can be employed to elucidate the intricacies behind challenges encountered in marriage statistics and data analysis. This framework not only enables a more profound understanding of marriage dynamics but also unveils patterns and factors contributing to marital stability and divorce rates. The paper further emphasizes that these complex binary structures are not abstract constructs but are naturally woven into the fabric of human existence, shaping the daily interplay of social connections and genealogical ties. In essence, this study highlights the importance of embracing the complexity inherent in human relationships and the valuable insights that complex binary chains can provide in comprehending and analyzing these intricate social and familial dynamics.

Complex Binary Chains Part Two
Contracts & Agreements
BY NATHANIEL M. A. BURMAN
University of Central Florida School of Business Administration & School of Computer Science & Engineering

Relationships are more complex than what has been previously discovered, and using complex binary structures helps us to see how relationships really move through time.

A contract between the boy and girl exists which connects them in time.
Modern marriage contracts can be represented using binary chains and can be made more complex.

Some binary chain/contracts can be broken by attacks. Attacks can come from other binary chains or from singles. 
Singles are dangerous to binary chains in this system. Singles attack binary chains and can break connections.

Some connections can be hidden and can be revealed using this system.

This displays a relationship where a man is married to a woman and has another binary contract with a woman, using an unspoken Girlfriend Contract.
True Marriages emerge inside of a complex binary system of relationships.

ABSTRACT:
"Complex Binary Chains Part Two: Contracts & Agreements" by Nathaniel M. A. Burman, a continuation of the exploration from the University of Central Florida, delves deeper into the intricate dynamics of human relationships. This paper underscores the notion that relationships are far more complex than previously understood, with a particular focus on the role of complex binary structures in revealing the true nature of these connections over time.
The paper highlights the existence of contracts between individuals, such as those between a boy and a girl, and how these contracts serve as connectors in the unfolding narrative of relationships. Notably, modern marriage contracts are discussed as being amenable to representation through binary chains, and their complexity can be further elaborated upon.
The paper also explores the vulnerabilities inherent in these binary chains, which may be subjected to attacks from external forces, including "singles." The text touches upon the idea that certain connections may remain concealed until revealed through the lens of this binary system.
Intriguingly, the paper paints a vivid picture of complex relationships where a single individual may be married to one person while holding another binary contract with someone else, akin to an unspoken "Girlfriend Contract." It introduces the concept of "true marriages" emerging within the context of a complex binary network of relationships.
This academic contribution propels us to reevaluate our understanding of relationships and agreements, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of human connections, while emphasizing the significant role played by complex binary chains in this intricate web of social bonds.

There is so much more I have not compiled on structures and physics and engineering and psychology in complex monogamy. I will release more in time.
